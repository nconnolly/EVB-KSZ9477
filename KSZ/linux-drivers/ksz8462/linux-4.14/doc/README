These are the files for the KSZ8462/KSZ8441/KSZ8852 HLI driver.  Please copy
them to the appropriate directories under the Linux kernel source tree.

The files under drivers/net/ethernet/micrel can be copied without changes if
they do not exist in the original Linux kernel.

The "Kconfig" file contains a KSZ8462_HLI configuration.  Please patch the
change to the Micrel network drivers Kconfig file.

The "Makefile" file contains a line to compile the KSZ8462 driver.  Please add
it to the Micrel network drivers Makefile file.

The "arch_setup_ksz8462" file contains sample code to register the KSZ8462 HLI
device.  Please update it appropriately for the host system.

If 1588 PTP function is required then the files under drivers/ptp should be
patched to the files in that directory.


These are the shared files for the KSZ8463 switch:

	ks846xReg.h
	ks886xReg.h
	ksz8463.h
	ksz_sw.h
	ksz_sw.c
	ksz_sysfs.h
	ksz_sw_sysfs.c

These are the shared files for the 1588 PTP function:

	ksz_ptp.h
	ksz_ptp.c
	ksz_ptp_sysfs.c
	micrel_ptp.c

This is a shared file for the KSZ8462 drivers:

	ksz8462.h

These are the shared files for Micrel drivers:

	ksz_req.h
	ksz_req.c
	ksz_common.c
	ksz_common.h


Note the 1588 PTP function is defaulted to be on for KSZ8462/KSZ8841.  For
KSZ8852 that does not require PTP function it needs to be manually turned off
in the kernel configuration.

The kernel configuration utility is invoked by the "make ARCH=arm menuconfig"
command, where CPU architecture may be different.

Select Device Drivers -> Network device support -> Ethernet driver support and
go down to Micrel devices.  There are bunch of Micrel Ethernet devices listed.
One of them is "Micrel KSZ8462 HLI support."  The "1588 PTP support" underneath
it is enabled by default.  Disable that option and then exit the configuration
utility to save the kernel configurations.

An alternative way is to modify the provided Kconfig file and set the default
to "n" before patching it.  But then it needs to be manually turned on for
KSZ8462/KSZ8841.

Another quick way to disable PTP function in the driver is not to define the
CONFIG_1588_PTP conditional.


The tools directory contains user applications that interacts with the switch.

The regs_bin utility uses the standard Linux register access API to access the
switch registers.  The network device "eth0" or SPI device "spi0.0" needs to
be supplied to specify which device to use with the register access API.

The ptp_cli utility can be used to access the 1588 PTP function of the switch.

The ptp utility in the ptp_net directory can be used to send and receive PTP
messages for testing purpose.
